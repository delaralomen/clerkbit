# ClerkBit - A Tailored Digital Assistant For Any Business

It’s your digital employee who takes orders, answers questions, collects Bitcoin, and tracks revenue.
## Key Features
It is your own in every sense of the word:
- you own your data
- you choose what AI model fits your needs
- you host your model & Bitcoin node

## Example Use Case
A café, shop, or service provider can run their own intelligent assistant — no subscriptions, no cloud lock-in, no outages — just smart, private, Bitcoin-powered AI on-premises.
1. A Lugano café installs the self-hosted app.
2. They configure the AI component of our app to serve as a chatbot that greets and take orders from customers.
3. Payments go directly to the café’s BTC wallet via Lightning NWC integration.
4. The café gets to collect analytics based on which they issue special discounts for recurring customers.
5. Locals or tourists interact with the app via QR code or web app, paying in Bitcoin.

## What are we tackling with this solution?

Combining payments with AI can be extremely tricky; here comes ClerkBit into play, a fully-tailored digital assistant for any business. Our platform's main focus is to provide a secure and auditable solution that serves as an interface between the Lightning network, the merchant's services, and the customer. It empowers both business owners and customers, as all transactional data is stored locally. Sovereignty, adaptability, security. All thanks to the self-hosting feature of the AI model and the Bitcoin node.
