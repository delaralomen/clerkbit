# ClerkBit - A Tailored Digital Assistant For Any Business

It’s your digital employee who takes orders, answers questions, collects Bitcoin, and tracks order revenue.

## Key Features
It is your own in every sense of the word:
- you own your data
- you choose what AI model fits your needs
- you get to choose how you host your Bitcoin node

## Example Use Case
A café, shop, or service provider can run their own intelligent assistant in the following scenario:
1. A Lugano café installs the self-hosted app.
2. They configure the AI component of our app to serve as a chatbot that greets and take orders from customers.
3. Payments go directly to the café’s BTC wallet via Lightning NWC integration.
4. Locals or tourists interact with the app via QR code or web app in any language they prefer, paying in Bitcoin.

## What are we tackling with this solution?

Combining payments with AI can be extremely tricky; here comes ClerkBit into play, a fully-tailored digital assistant for any business. Our platform's main focus is to provide a secure and auditable solution that serves as an interface between the Lightning network, the merchant's services, and the customer. It empowers both business owners and customers, as it makes business processes quicker and costs lower. For this hackathon, we tailored our MVP to showcase a digital assistant in a café setting—reflecting Lugano’s café culture and its strong embrace of Bitcoin.
